OBJECTIVE TRACKER FOR PIX.LY

Updated mental model:
- we're not retrieving files from the bucket, we're just trying to view files from the bucket in the browser
- to do so, we're giving anon users READ access in our bucket's permissions -- **bucket policy**

then we should be able to click on the link and see the image (that'll demonstrate that we've enabled the proper permissions)


- learn how to use s3 object


main paths:
photo manipulation - ways to download the image, store it on server so that you can make changes to it (you can't manipulate it while in bucket)
data focus - EXIF data

go onto YouTube to look for general tutorials
